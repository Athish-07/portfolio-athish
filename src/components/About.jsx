        <p>
          I’m a Java developer with around one year of experience working in
          production support for large-scale banking systems. My work involves
          understanding how real systems behave under load and how to keep them
          stable.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have hands-on experience with Java, Spring Boot, Linux, WebLogic, and
          IBM MQ, and I enjoy building clean backend services with clear
          responsibilities. Currently, I’m expanding into full-stack development
          using React while strengthening my core Java and system design
          fundamentals.
